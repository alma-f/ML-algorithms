# ML-algorithms
This project contains the following machine learning algorithms with code in Python and R:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
3. Logistic Regression
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis
5. Classification and Regression Trees
6. Naive Bayes
7.Gaussian Naive Bayes
8. K-Nearest Neighbors
9. Learning Vector Quantization
10. Support Vector Machines
11. Bagged Decision Trees
12. AdaBoost


This project is based in Master Machine Learning Algorithms book by Jason Brownlee, so refer to the book for learning and understanding the algorithms. The book has tutorials on each algorithm using any spreadsheet app. I converted those tutorials in R and Python.
